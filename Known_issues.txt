We need to check if a Students table entry exists and enter relevant details
    if they do not every time a student or president logs in

Should implement proper access limits (student must not be able to access
    president, faculty, etc)

President is referred to by userId instead of student Id atm

Check if club president's club exists every time a president logs in. If not
    redirect to club creation page
